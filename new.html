          Every petal of this ROSE symbolizes a cherished moment we have shared together, and
          as I look at it, I am reminded of how grateful I am to have you by my side.
          Our journey together is as sweet as the fragrance of roses. Happy Rose Day, Shalu. Here's to many more petals of shared laughter and enduring love.
